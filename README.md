WebSnake - Big ups, forever.

A screenshoting tool written in Golang based on HackedBaked's webgrabber hotness https://github.com/HackedBaked/OSCP_Scripts/blob/main/webgrabber

It will take scan results from tools like gobuster, feroxbuster, ffuf then create target folders for URLs and begin screenshotting all directories present on hosts in the scan results file.
